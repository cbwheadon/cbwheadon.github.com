## Running R in the cloud

So you want to run R in the cloud so you can set your Gibbs sampling off, forget about it, and not be paranoid about power cuts and reboots. Andrew Gelman hosted a good debate on this on his <A href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/r_on_the_cloud/">blog</A>.

The consensus seems to be <A href="http://rstudio.org/">RStudio and EC2</A>. P.S. If you haven't got Andrew's book <A href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/">Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (2007)</A> go and steal one. Seriously. Anyway, here is a lovely intro on how how to go down the <A href="http://toreopsahl.com/2011/10/17/securely-using-r-and-rstudio-on-amazons-ec2/">R EC2 route</A>

There you have it. If you want to run R on a 64-bit server with googles of power, that is your answer. So long as you know your cat from your whoami.

The question is whether we want web services running useful tools for those who don't give a cat about a whoami. I don't know. But I do know that people love my <A href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</A> graphs, but they haven't got time to configure <A href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/rjags.pdf">rjags</A> on EC2. World of pain. Believe me. So perhaps that is where we should start...
