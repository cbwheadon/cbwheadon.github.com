CRAN keeps a list of web interfaces for R : <A href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-Web-Interfaces">here.</A>

While these offer platforms for developing R, far less work has been done on providing services based on R. They must exist...

Jeroen is the pioneer of R web services as far as I can tell. Linear models and ggplots in web interfaces. Check them out <A  href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/">here.</A>

Looks like traditional software!
